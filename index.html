                <li><a href="#">Resume</a></li>
                <p>During the several months I have made many different copies of this online resume. I started this during Resilient Bootcamp to use to apply to jobs and have continued to updated and change the layout to fit the position I was in as time changed.</p>
                <li><a href="#">2016 Racquet Guide Magazine</a></li>
                <p>This magazine was made to work on css. I did this to get the practice and to learn the skills of how much css can do.</p>
                <li><a href="#">Tennis Industry Magazine</a></li>
                <p>This magazine cover was to give me a different taste of css and to see my skill level for myself. As well as to see how many magazine covers I could do in a week.</p>
                <li><a href="#">Teen Empowerment Home Page</a></li>
                <p>Part of the Resilient Coders bootcamp was to give experience that goes towards working in the web development field. The assignment was to work on a mock client work and collaberate with fellow group members. Also to make responsive and finish by the deadline.</p>
                <li><a href="#">Metro Newspaper Front Page</a></li>
                <p>This was the final thing I did during the bootcamp. I had finished with the work and needed something to do while others were working. I got to learn more about the little details and how to put them in place.</p>
